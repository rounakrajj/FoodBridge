## 🌟 Why FoodBridge?

🚨 40% of food produced is wasted — while 1 in 9 people go hungry.  
🏪 Restaurants and grocers discard edible food due to logistical gaps.  
🙋 Volunteers want to help but lack tools for coordination.

**FoodBridge solves this by building a real-time, AI-powered platform for food recovery and redistribution — optimized for hyperlocal impact.**
